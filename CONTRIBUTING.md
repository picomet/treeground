## Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository
1. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b my-branch-name`)
1. Run the development server (`npm run dev`)
1. Make your change
1. Format your code (`npm run format`)
1. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
1. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-branch-name`)
1. Create a Pull Request from your branch
1. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
